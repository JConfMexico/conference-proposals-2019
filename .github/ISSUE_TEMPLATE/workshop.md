## About Me

## JDD

We are a non profit group of devs working on this for free.
Our sponsors help us to pay for the expenses, however we know many companies encourage their employees to be part of this kind of conferences for branding and exposure.
Would you need support for travel expenses to participate at JDD 2019?
